# Bamazon

"Bamazon" is a CLI app that is essentially an Amazon store front where the user enters their order and the app checks if what they want is in stock. If said item is in stock, the app will place their order.

The app useses the npm "inquirer" to ask the user the question "What is the 'ID Number' of the product you would like to buy?". You will enter an ID between 1-10 to get a response. Below, we're entering 1 for a costume.
